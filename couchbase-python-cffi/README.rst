Couchbase FFI

This provides the FFI backend for the
`couchbase <http://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client>`_ module. This
project is mainly of use to those who wish to use the couchbase module with
`pypy`. Normal CPython extensions do not work very well on pypy, and thus
the recommended way of interfacing via `pypy` in a C library is to use the
`cffi` module.

**See the _1.x_ branch for the version of this module that uses the 1.x client
and API (though ffi module in that branch is no longer maintained)**

Using
-----

You will need the `cffi` Python module (the newer, the better), the libcouchbase
development files, and the actual `couchbase` module (see its instructions for
how to build it).

**Each version of the CFFI library has a strict dependency on an exact version
of the couchbase Python client, due to the tight coupling of internals**.

**The current version depends on**:

* libcouchbase > 2.4.7
* couchbase = 2.0.0-beta2 (or 2.0.0b2)

Once you've built all that, you must load this module first before any others;
thus::

    import couchbase_ffi
    from couchbase.bucket import Bucket
    # ...


This module will **inject itself** as the ``couchbase._libcouchbase`` module,
allowing you to use anything that depends on the C extension normally.

This module does *not* monkey-patch the couchbase ``Bucket`` class, but rather
the underlying C internals; therefore the ability of a drop-in increases.

The first time you use the module, the `couchbase_ffi._cinit` module will
attempt to generate the appropriate stubs for the library. Regeneration may
also take place if you have upgraded your libcouchbase installation.

Because regenerating the header might involve some hacks in dynamically
patching the header file to make it acceptable to `pycparser`, it may fail
at times.


Ennvironment variables affecting how the headers are built:

* ``PYCBC_CFFI_REGENERATE`` forces the header to be rebuilt
* ``PYCBC_CFFI_PREFIX`` sets the installation prefix for libcouchbase


Implemented Features
--------------------

Everything the normal C extension supports. This has been tested using the
normal `couchbase.tests` module *and* the twisted tests.

I may have missed something here and there, but I can't think of anything
that isn't supported.

TODO
----

Better tests.

Performance
-----------

Here are some examples using the ``bench.py`` script in the main Couchbase
Python distribution. These were all executed against a locally running
memcached like so

Example::

     ./examples/txbench.py -U memcached://localhost -t 1 -C 1
     #....

The *T* and *C* values show how many total clients were spawned, and how many
independent logical sequences (threads) of operations were being performed.
